# JavaScript Practice Repository

Welcome to my **JavaScript Practice Repository**, a personal learning space where I explore JavaScript concepts step-by-step.    
This repo  contains ** codes focused on user input validation and logic building**.

## üìú Project Overview

This repository documents my learning progress in **JavaScript fundamentals** from simple variables and conditionals to interactive programs using Node.js.

### üîπ Current Focus (New Progress)
I recently added a new project file:  
**`LoginJSValidations.js`**

This script demonstrates how to:
- Accept user input from the terminal using Node.js `readline` module.
- Validate username and password fields.
- Check that both fields are not empty.
- Compare user input with the correct stored credentials.
- Validate password strength using **Regular Expressions (RegEx)** to ensure it contains:
  - At least one uppercase letter  
  - At least one lowercase letter  
  - At least one number  
  - At least one special character (`&$@#!?+`)  
  - Minimum 5 characters in length
